<p>Version 0.0.3 of the project.

THIS IS PART 2 OF 2 CONSECUTIVE COMMITS

Notes: Erased all objectives. Those who were still not met will be completed before 0.0.4
This is the last commit before documentation is written.

0.0.4 will take about 2 months to complete due to the difficult tasks our team has chosen
for ourselves. As of today, the current version will be integrated with Redux and if there
is any time left in those 2 months, backend will be reworked in Hacklang.

Documentation comes in the next commit. All commits until 31.05.2017 will be meant to either
write the Documentation or fix bugs/sanitize/reorganize files.
As of today, the project is fully operational.
